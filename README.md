I have utilized this guys source example template to make a kotlin version of the Website https://devdocs.io
THIS WILL NOT BE OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED as it will use a webveiw, not truely offline I know, but it will do. 

## THINGS TO DO
[ ]	Remove annoying Header Bar

[ ]	Suppress "Devdocs is running in Webveiw message"

[ ]	Enable app cache to make the app know it can actually cache itself
