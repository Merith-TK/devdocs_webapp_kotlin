I have utilized this guys source example template to make a kotlin version of the Website https://devdocs.io
THIS WILL NOT BE OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED as it will use a webveiw, not truely offline I know, but it will do. 

### WARNING! ###
# THIS APP HAS ONLY BEEN OFFICIALLY TESTED ON ANDROID 8 OREO, IF IT WORKS ON YOUR VERSION OF ANDROID, SUBMIT A "Issue" SO THAT I CAN ADD THE VERSIONS TESTED

## IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH GRADLE
	Go to the cloned repo, and delete `.idea` and `.gradle` and let Android-Studio rebuild these directories, 
	This may require you to restart Android-Studio
	
	This project is being developed crossplatform from Win10 and ArchLinux, 
	If you receive a folder error like `/home/nala/` or `C:\Users\Merith` does not exist,
	you can safely ignore that.

## CURRENT ISSUES
None at the current moment in time


## THINGS TO DO
### NOTHING!!! (until notified)

## ORIGINAL SOURCE
https://github.com/QuaestioOrg/kotlin-converted-webview/

Used because i had no clue how to start a webveiw in kotlin as the documentation seems rather...sparse for me.

Who knows, may just be me.
