# Contributing

This sample is open to contributions and the following guidelines are a manner to communicate the best way to positively contribute to it.

Contributors must follow the guidelines in order to submit well-formed pull requests and to open useful issues.

The guidelines standards are helpful to avoid having your pull requests or issues eventually rejected.

## Guidelines

Create good issues or pull requests following the guidelines.

Do search and read about the previous submitted entries prior to submit new ones to this repository.

### Issues

[**Issues**](https://github.com/QuaestioOrg/kotlin-converted-webview/issues) are generally opened by the author of this sample, but contributors may specially open new issues whenever they stumble upon official warnings notified by Android Studio code inspection during the use of the sample which have not been reported by the repository owner previously.

Be sure to clearly entitle and comment the issue by providing relevant information and a code sample or a test demonstration.

Whoever opens the issue must provide a well formatted text respecting the rules written next: 

* **the title** of the issue should be extracted from the first phrase (not the headline and without punctuation) of the warning note and written between quotes (replacing inside quotes for single quotes) like:
>"Overrides deprecated member in 'android.webkit.WebViewClient'"

* **the description** of an issue should report the code inspection warning and replicate the affected piece of code or log reports besides adding a brief definition about the situation; subjective interferences are not desirable. 

* **the reference** should be provided from the best sources in topics and:

a) when singular: "reference" with the word linked;
b) when plural: "reference reference..." with each word linked.  

* **the label** should be applied exclusively by the repository owner.

**WARNING:** do not open up an issue whether the bug is a security vulnerability; instead send a private e-mail informing the repository owner directly.

Just follow the [**Issue Template**](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for the best experience.

### Pull Requests

[**Pull Requests**](https://github.com/QuaestioOrg/kotlin-converted-webview/pulls) must clearly describe the problem and the solution so as to demonstrate its validity and associate the issues related.

## References

The first couple of opened issues are a good sample displaying the guidelines followed by this project in practice; have a look:
1. ["Overrides deprecated member in 'android.webkit.WebViewClient'"](https://github.com/QuaestioOrg/kotlin-converted-webview/issues/1)
2. ["Redundant override"](https://github.com/QuaestioOrg/kotlin-converted-webview/issues/2)

Later a pull request example might be available here.

And soon a **Code of Conduct** will be linked here too.

If you have any doubts, please, do not hesitate to send an e-mail to: org.quaestio@quaestio.org.

## Thanks

Please, contribute to improve this sample with good faith and help to solve the ongoing issues by dedicating positive support in your pull requests.

Thank you in advance!
